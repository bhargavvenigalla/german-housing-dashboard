# 🏠 German Public Housing & Living Conditions Dashboard (2022)

## 📊 Overview
This Power BI dashboard explores Germany’s housing landscape based on official data from the **2022 Microcensus** by [DESTATIS](https://www.destatis.de/EN/Themes/Society-Environment/Housing/_node.html). It provides a visual overview of **home ownership vs. renting trends**, **household types**, **financial burden**, and **demographic segmentation**.

The goal is to offer insights into how different household structures in Germany are affected by housing conditions and policy.
